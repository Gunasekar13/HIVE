If we have large dataset having large no.of partition need bucketing

✔It decided by "Hashing Algorithom" .
✔We can explicitly set the number of buckets during table creation.
✔It helps Bucketed map joins are fastest joins.
   Condition : Both table bucketed same column and should have same no.of buckets. 
   
   
By default bucketing is disabled now enabled
hive> set hive.enforce.bucketing = true;
hive> set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict;

✍#Create bucketing Table

hive> create table if not exists dept_buck_table (
deptid int,
empname string,
empid int,
location string
)
partitioned by (deptname string)
clustered by (location) into 4 buckets
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
stored as textfile
;
    
 hive> insert into table dept_buck_table partition(deptname) select deptid,empname,empid,location,deptname from dept_table;
