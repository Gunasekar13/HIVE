If we have large dataset having large no.of partition need bucketing

It decided by "Hashing Algorithom" .

By default bucketing is disabled now enabled
hive> set hive.enforce.bucketing = true;
hive> set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict;

✍#Create bucketing Table

hive> create table if not exists dept_buck_table (
    > deptid int,
    > empname string,
    > empid int
    > )
    > partitioned by (deptname string)
    > clustered by (location) into 4 buckets
    > row format delimited
    > fields terminated by ','
    > stored as textfile
    > ;
