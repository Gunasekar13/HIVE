In real time we have transform the Terabyte and betabyte of data. we Query particular dept data it will take search unnessery dept also it take time.

for example :
    We have query to find particular department data.In this case all department will be stored at sub directory.It help us to fast transmission.

👉Before partitioning :
        hdfs://localhost/user/hive/warehouse/emp
        
👉#Partion have two types
      ✔Static - we know the partition value
      ✔Dynamic - We don't know the distinct value
      
✍ Static Partitioning:

create table employee_table(
empno int,
ename string,
job string,
mgr int,
Hiredate date,
sal int,
comm int
)
partitioned by (deptno int)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
stored as textfile;

hive> insert into table employee_table partition(deptno=10) select empno,ename,job,mgr,Hiredate,sal,comm from emp;

👉After partitioning :
        hdfs://localhost/user/hive/warehouse/employee_table/deptno=10
        
✍ Dynamic Partitioning:

By default dynamic partition is disable it. We have to enable it.

hive> set hive.exec.dynamic.partition=true;
hive> set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict;

create table employee(
empno int,
ename string,
mgr int,
hiredate date,
sal int,
comm int
)
partitioned by(job string)
row format delimited
fields terminated by','
stored as textfile
;

----Must mentioned the partition column as last----
hive> insert into table employee partition(job) select empno,ename,mgr,hiredate,sal,comm,job from emp;

👉After partitioning :
       
       hdfs://localhost/user/hive/warehouse/employee/job=CLERK
       hdfs://localhost/user/hive/warehouse/employee/job=MANAGER
       hdfs://localhost/user/hive/warehouse/employee/job=PRESIDENT
       hdfs://localhost/user/hive/warehouse/employee/job=SALESMAN
       
       
✍ #drop partition 

hive> alter table employee_data drop partition (deptno=10);

--------------------------------------------------
✍Multi dynamic partition;

create table multi_part(
empno int,
ename string,
mgr int,
hiredate date,
sal int,
comm int
)
partitioned by (deptno int,job string)
row format delimited 
fields terminated by ','
stored as textfile
;

hive> insert into table multi_part partition (deptno,job) select empno,ename,mgr,hiredate,sal,comm,deptno,job from emp;
