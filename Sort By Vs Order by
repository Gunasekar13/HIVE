When should we use SORT BY instead of ORDER BY?
===========================================

Despite ORDER BY we should use SORT BY. Especially while we have to sort huge datasets. The reason is SORT BY clause sorts the data using multiple reducers. 
ORDER BY sorts all of the data together using a single reducer.

Hence, using ORDER BY will take a lot of time to execute a large number of inputs
