INTERNAL TABLE :
       # when your drop the internal table the data and meta will be deleted.
       
EXTERNAL TABLE :
        # when you go to drop the External Table the meta data will be deleted from hive.
        # But the actual data will be available in HDFS locations.
        # We can able to recreate the table again.
     If you want to delete data also use 'rmr' command to delete the data.
     
     
EXTERNAL TABLE is best case because the data was use to work in multiple tech like Spark,hive,Pig.
