1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

2. Store raw data into hdfs location
    #make new directory in hdfs location
 
      hadoop fs -mkdir  hdfs://localhost/sales_order_csv
   
    # Copy the file local to hdfs
    
        hadoop fs -put '/config/workspace/.vscode/File_system/sales_order_data.csv' 'hdfs://localhost/sales_order_csv/'
        
    #check file is available in hdfs location
    
        hadoop fs -ls hdfs://localhost/sales_order_csv/
        
3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_data" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table
    
hive> create table if not exists sales_order_data
    > (
    > ORDERNUMBER int,
    > QUANTITYORDERED int,
    > PRICEEACH decimal(5,2),
    > ORDERLINENUMBER int,
    > SALES int,
    > STATUS string,
    > QTR_ID int,
    > MONTH_ID int,
    > YEAR_ID int,
    > PRODUCTLINE string,
    > MSRP int,
    > PRODUCTCODE string,
    > PHONE string,
    > CITY string,
    > STATE string,
    > POSTALCODE int,
    > COUNTRY string,
    > TERRITORY string,
    > CONTACTLASTNAME string,
    > CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
    > DEALSIZE string
    > )
    > row format delimited
    > fields terminated by ','
    > tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1")
    > ;
4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_data" table

hive> load data  inpath 'hdfs://localhost/sales_order_csv/sales_order_data.csv' into table sales_order_data;

5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"
hive> create table if not exists sales_order_orc
    > (
    > ORDERNUMBER int,
    > QUANTITYORDERED int,
    > PRICEEACH decimal(5,2),
    > ORDERLINENUMBER int,
    > SALES int,
    > STATUS string,
    > QTR_ID int,
    > MONTH_ID int,
    > YEAR_ID int,
    > PRODUCTLINE string,
    > MSRP int,
    > PRODUCTCODE string,
    > PHONE string,
    > CITY string,
    > STATE string,
    > POSTALCODE int,
    > COUNTRY string,
    > TERRITORY string,
    > CONTACTLASTNAME string,
    > CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
    > DEALSIZE string
    > )
    > stored as orc
    > tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1")
    > ;

6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"

hive> insert into table sales_order_orc select *from sales_order_data;

7. Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

   a. Calculatye total sales per year
   b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
   c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
   d. In which quarter sales was minimum
   e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
   f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
   h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold
