Scenario Based questions:

1. Will the reducer work or not if you use “Limit 1” in any HiveQL query?
      
      It depends on the query.
 
 2. Suppose I have installed Apache Hive on top of my Hadoop cluster using default metastore configuration.
 Then, what will happen if we have multiple clients trying to access Hive at the same time? 

       Default metastore configuration was standalone.It can be access only one clients. It cann't able to share across the cluster. If trying to access
multiple client it can be error.

3. Suppose, I create a table that contains details of all the transactions done by the customers: CREATE TABLE transaction_details (cust_id INT, amount FLOAT, month STRING, country STRING) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ‘,’ ;
Now, after inserting 50,000 records in this table, I want to know the total revenue generated for each month. But, Hive is taking too much time in processing this query. How will you solve this problem and list the steps that I will be taking in order to do so?

      Solution for this case 'Partitioning'. Create the partition based on the month.
      # create partition table 
         hive> create table if not exists transaction_partition_details(
             > cust_id int,
             > amount float,
             > country string
             > )
             > partitioned by (month string)
             > row format delimited
             > fields terminated by ','
             > ;
       # enable the dynamic partition 
         hive> SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode = nonstrict;
       # load the data to the partition table 
         hive> insert overwrite table transaction_partition_details partition (month) select *from transaction_details;
       # Query the data
          Query will executed eaach month and past.
 
4. How can you add a new partition for the month December in the above partitioned table?
